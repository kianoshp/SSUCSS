#My CSS SSUCSS!

Let's face it. ALL CSS frameworks SUCK! They are way too complicated and come with WAY too much opinion of the UI developer that engineered it. Bootstrap/Foundation/Susy/etc. is great for the person who created it, but for every user I encounter I hear the same complaints over and over: the opinions are too overwhelming, the API is overly complex and the hockey stick of complexity, once you step outside the solutions they provide, is way too steep!

Concepts like OOCSS and SMACSS only get us so far. These are good foundational process frameworks, but their teachings stop short of real world solutions. It has been up to the designers and developers to re-invent the wheel time and time again. It's time to have a clear choice in process and implementation technology. It's time for a solution that doesn't over-promise quick results by over-enforcing its personal opinion. It's time for something better that we can all use!

##A no BS Foundation!
Ok, we get it. We are in a technological industry and developers are lazy (I mean that in a good sense). We need tools that help us get our jobs done the fastest. But using libraries like Bootstrap are not the  answer. The Bootstrap 3.01 CSS release has 106 instances of "!important". Really?! As UI dev professionals, is this the tool that we want representing our craft? I think not. As development professionals, is this the foundation from which we want to build our visual experience? I think not.
