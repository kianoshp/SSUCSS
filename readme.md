#My CSS SSUCSS!

Let's face it. ALL CSS frameworks SUCK! They are way too complicated and come with WAY to much opinion of the UI developer that engineered it. Bootstrap and Foundation are great for the people who created it, but for every user I encounter I hear the same complaints over and over. The opinions are to overwhelming, the API is overly complex and the hockey stick of complexity, once you step outside the solutions they provide, is way too steep!

Concepts like OOCSS and SMACSS only get us so far. These are good foundational process frameworks, but their teachings stop short of real world solutions. It has been up to the designers and developers to re-invent the wheel time and time again. It's time to have a clear choice in process and implementation technology. It's time for a solution that doesn't over promise quick results by over enforcing it's personal opinion. It's time for a new BS foundation that we can all use!

##A no BS Foundation!
Ok, we get it. We are in a technological industry and developers are lazy (I mean that in a good sense). We need tools that help us get our job done the fastest. But using libraries like Bootstrap are not the better answer. The Bootstrap 3.01 CSS release has 106 instances of "!important". Really?! As UI dev professionals, is this the tool that we want representing out craft? I think not. As development professionals, is this the foundation what we want to build our visual experience from? I think not.
